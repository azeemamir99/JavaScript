00:00:00,900  -->  00:00:03,410
<v ->Congratulations on finishing</v>
3

3

00:00:03,410  -->  00:00:06,350
the introduction to JavaScript.
4

4

00:00:06,350  -->  00:00:09,620
So you mastered the absolute fundamentals,
5

5

00:00:09,620  -->  00:00:13,060
but there is still a lot of content ahead.
6

6

00:00:13,060  -->  00:00:16,610
In fact, there is over 50 hours of video left
7

7

00:00:16,610  -->  00:00:18,220
in this course.
8

8

00:00:18,220  -->  00:00:22,480
However, I know that this is way too much for some people.
9

9

00:00:22,480  -->  00:00:25,140
And so let's not take five or 10 minutes
10

10

00:00:25,140  -->  00:00:28,940
to plan your unique journey through this course,
11

11

00:00:28,940  -->  00:00:32,720
so that you can achieve your own learning goals.
12

12

00:00:32,720  -->  00:00:36,690
Now to start, keep in mind that this is after all
13

13

00:00:36,690  -->  00:00:39,110
the complete JavaScript course.
14

14

00:00:39,110  -->  00:00:42,350
And so it makes sense that it covers everything,
15

15

00:00:42,350  -->  00:00:46,540
and has a lot of big projects and challenges.
16

16

00:00:46,540  -->  00:00:50,030
That's the reason why this course is so long.
17

17

00:00:50,030  -->  00:00:51,900
But here is the thing,
18

18

00:00:51,900  -->  00:00:54,430
you don't need to watch the entire course
19

19

00:00:54,430  -->  00:00:57,680
to become really good at JavaScript.
20

20

00:00:57,680  -->  00:01:00,920
There are many lectures and some sections
21

21

00:01:00,920  -->  00:01:05,523
that you can safely skip and still become a great developer.
22

22

00:01:06,400  -->  00:01:08,370
Now watching the entire course,
23

23

00:01:08,370  -->  00:01:10,590
is, of course, the best option.
24

24

00:01:10,590  -->  00:01:12,670
So if you're planning on doing that,
25

25

00:01:12,670  -->  00:01:15,110
then just go to the next section.
26

26

00:01:15,110  -->  00:01:17,100
But if you don't have the time,
27

27

00:01:17,100  -->  00:01:19,720
or if you really want to focus only
28

28

00:01:19,720  -->  00:01:24,010
on the most important parts and on your own learning goal,
29

29

00:01:24,010  -->  00:01:26,260
then just keep watching.
30

30

00:01:26,260  -->  00:01:29,910
So to help you navigate through this massive course
31

31

00:01:29,910  -->  00:01:31,910
according to your goals,
32

32

00:01:31,910  -->  00:01:35,590
I created a couple of different pathways through the course
33

33

00:01:35,590  -->  00:01:39,190
and also a roadmap for each section.
34

34

00:01:39,190  -->  00:01:42,830
So a section roadmap is basically an overview
35

35

00:01:42,830  -->  00:01:44,260
of each section,
36

36

00:01:44,260  -->  00:01:46,690
which will tell you exactly which videos
37

37

00:01:46,690  -->  00:01:49,020
are the most important ones,
38

38

00:01:49,020  -->  00:01:51,810
which ones are not that important,
39

39

00:01:51,810  -->  00:01:54,490
and which ones are optional.
40

40

00:01:54,490  -->  00:01:56,490
And you can find these roadmaps
41

41

00:01:56,490  -->  00:01:59,410
at the beginning of each section.
42

42

00:01:59,410  -->  00:02:01,290
And so by using them,
43

43

00:02:01,290  -->  00:02:05,650
you can focus only on the most important videos if you want,
44

44

00:02:05,650  -->  00:02:09,440
and therefore complete the course a lot faster.
45

45

00:02:09,440  -->  00:02:13,940
So the section roadmaps tell you which videos you may skip.
46

46

00:02:13,940  -->  00:02:17,530
But you might also want to skip entire sections.
47

47

00:02:17,530  -->  00:02:20,260
So sections that you don't need to watch
48

48

00:02:20,260  -->  00:02:22,980
in order to achieve your learning goal.
49

49

00:02:22,980  -->  00:02:27,260
And so that's where the course pathways come into play.
50

50

00:02:27,260  -->  00:02:31,620
So I defined these seven learning goals that you might have,
51

51

00:02:31,620  -->  00:02:34,350
and selected the sections that you should watch
52

52

00:02:34,350  -->  00:02:37,070
in order to achieve that goal.
53

53

00:02:37,070  -->  00:02:40,710
And the seven pathways are any PDF document
54

54

00:02:40,710  -->  00:02:44,130
that you can find right in the next lecture.
55

55

00:02:44,130  -->  00:02:46,510
But just as an example here,
56

56

00:02:46,510  -->  00:02:48,250
your goal might be to learn
57

57

00:02:48,250  -->  00:02:52,350
only the most important parts of JavaScript.
58

58

00:02:52,350  -->  00:02:55,200
And this might actually be a great goal
59

59

00:02:55,200  -->  00:02:57,520
for Udemy for Business students,
60

60

00:02:57,520  -->  00:03:00,483
who are probably watching this course at work.
61

61

00:03:01,350  -->  00:03:04,830
Now, in this case, your pathway through the course
62

62

00:03:04,830  -->  00:03:07,960
is gonna look something like this.
63

63

00:03:07,960  -->  00:03:10,600
So just like in the section roadmaps,
64

64

00:03:10,600  -->  00:03:12,740
here you can see which sections
65

65

00:03:12,740  -->  00:03:15,460
are very important for your goal,
66

66

00:03:15,460  -->  00:03:18,180
which ones are just good to know,
67

67

00:03:18,180  -->  00:03:21,010
and which ones are optional.
68

68

00:03:21,010  -->  00:03:25,070
And so again, by following a pathway like this,
69

69

00:03:25,070  -->  00:03:27,440
you don't have to watch the entire course
70

70

00:03:27,440  -->  00:03:29,620
if you don't have the time.
71

71

00:03:29,620  -->  00:03:32,180
In fact, this particular pathway
72

72

00:03:32,180  -->  00:03:35,963
actually shrinks the course down to only 24 hours.
73

73

00:03:37,130  -->  00:03:38,040
All right.
74

74

00:03:38,040  -->  00:03:41,420
So again, the best option is of course,
75

75

00:03:41,420  -->  00:03:45,120
to watch the entire course from start to finish.
76

76

00:03:45,120  -->  00:03:47,240
But if you don't have the time,
77

77

00:03:47,240  -->  00:03:51,370
then please take a look at the course pathways PDF document
78

78

00:03:51,370  -->  00:03:52,940
in the next lecture,
79

79

00:03:52,940  -->  00:03:57,240
and select your learning goal and pathway from there.
80

80

00:03:57,240  -->  00:04:00,330
And then I see you wherever your path
81

81

00:04:00,330  -->  00:04:02,397
will take you in this course.
82

82

00:04:02,397  -->  00:04:05,064
(upbeat music)
